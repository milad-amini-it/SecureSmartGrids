# Smart Grid Security Framework

This repository implements a security framework for edge-based smart grids, integrating adversarial machine learning (scikit-learn + ART), federated learning (Flower), and blockchain (simulated with hashlib).

## Requirements
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Usage

    Run the server:
 ```bash

    python smart_grid_security.py
```


Features

Adversarial training with SVM and FGSM.
Federated learning across 4 simulated edge devices.
Blockchain logging of model updates.

Paper Reference

Based on: "Securing Edge-Based Smart Grids with Privacy-Preserving Adversarial Machine Learning and Blockchain Integration."
